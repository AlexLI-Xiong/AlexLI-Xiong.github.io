I'm a third-year PhD student in Finance at [the University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/). My research interests span human capital, innovation and sustainability.

I graduated from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/) in 2020 with a B.M. in Accounting and minor in Finance.
<!-- where I was admitted to the [Special Class for the Gifted Young](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Class_for_the_Gifted_Young) at the age of 14. -->

I will share my learning with you on this website!
