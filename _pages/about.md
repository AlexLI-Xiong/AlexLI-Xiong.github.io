Hi! I'm a 4th-year Accounting PhD candidate at the [University of Hong Kong Business School](https://www.hkubs.hku.hk/glocal/), with a research focus on supply chain, taxation, climate, and accounting regulations. I am interested in exploring the unintended economic impacts of public policies/regulations on supply chains and the role of supply chain networks in amplifying/propagating these effects.

Before studying business and economics, I was a PhD candidate in Chemistry, spending three years at the [Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology](https://www.oist.jp/) and [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/). I received my Bachelor of Science from [Jilin University](https://global.jlu.edu.cn/) in 2017 (Rank:1/123).


Currently, I am visiting [Prof. Xiumin Martin](https://www.xiuminmartinwustl.com/) at [Olin Business School of Washington University in St. Louis](https://olin.wustl.edu/), from 2023 onwards.
