I'm a third-year PhD student in Finance at [the University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/). My research interests span human capital, innovation and sustainability.

I earned my B.M. in Accounting from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/), where I was admitted to the [Special Class for the Gifted Young](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Class_for_the_Gifted_Young) at the age of 14.

I will share my learning with you on this website!
