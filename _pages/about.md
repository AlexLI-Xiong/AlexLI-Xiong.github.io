<!-- Hi! I'm a 5th-year Accounting PhD  at [HKU Business School](https://www.hkubs.hku.hk/glocal/).

My research interests focus on a niche but vital area: the ***trade credit market***. My work primarily explores two key dimensions of this field: *microeconomic contracting* and *macroeconomic implicatioins*. 

On the ***microeconomic level***, I investigate how accounting reporting and regulation results in a redistribution of trade credit. This research sheds light on the unintended costs and benefits that regulatory frameworks and financial disclosures impose on the trade credit market. 

On the ***macroeconomic level***, my research seeks to deepen the understanding of how trade credit networks can act as stabilizing forces within the economy, particularly during periods of financial uncertainty and policy shifts, such as those seen during fiscal policy adjustments and the COVID-19 crisis. -->

Hi! I’m a 5th-year Accounting PhD candidate at [University of Hong Kong](https://www.hkubs.hku.hk/glocal/). My research focuses on the trade credit market, a niche but critical area in accounting and finance. I investigate this topic from two perspectives: microeconomic contracting and macroeconomic implications. 
<!-- My research approaches this field from two key perspectives: *microeconomic contracting* and *macroeconomic implications*. On the microeconomic side, I explore how accounting reporting and regulatory frameworks influence the redistribution of trade credit, emphasizing the often-overlooked costs and benefits these frameworks impose on firms.

On the macroeconomic side, I examine how trade credit networks act as stabilizing forces within the broader economy, especially during periods of fiscal uncertainty and crises like COVID-19. By bridging these perspectives, my work aims to contribute valuable insights into both the micro and macro roles of trade credit in financial stability. -->


Over the past three decades, many important theoretical and empirical studies on trade credit have come from the fields of finance and economics, while accounting research seems to have lagged behind. Although trade credit is increasingly recognized as an important form of financing and accounting research has increasingly focused on how accounting information affects the supply and demand of trade credit, a holistic view of how accounting information affects thetrade credit market at whole and how trade credit networks function in the macroeconomy is still lacking. My research aims to fill this gap by providing an original and innovative perspective to deepen the understanding of trade credit from both microeconomic and macroeconomic perspectives. My research also expands the traditional motivation - the "financing advantage motivation" to incorporate other key drivers of trade credit, such as tax and product quality assurance considerations.

Before starting my academic journey in accounting, I earned a Master’s degree in Chemistry from the *Hong Kong University of Science and Technology* and a Bachelor’s degree in Science from *Jilin University*.

<!-- Currently, I am visiting PhD student at Washington University in St. Louis, until Nov 2024.  -->

<!-- My research intrests focus on niche research area on trade credit market. Sepcailly, I examine it  from both microeconomic contracting persepctive ( interacted accouting reporting and regulation) and marcroeconomic implications (tax, covid, et al.).
 -->

 <!-- this with a research focus on trade financing and accounting regulations. -->

<!-- Specifically, I am interested in exploring the **economic consequences (intended and unintended) of regulations within the supply chain context** and the **role of supply chain networks in transmitting these effects to a broader economy**. 

Before studying accounting, I was a PhD candidate in Chemistry, spending three years at [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/). I received my Bachelor of Science from [Jilin University](https://global.jlu.edu.cn/) in 2017 (Rank:1/123). -->
