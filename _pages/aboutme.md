<!-- Hi! I'm a 5th-year Accounting PhD  at [HKU Business School](https://www.hkubs.hku.hk/glocal/).

My research interests focus on a niche but vital area: the ***trade credit market***. My work primarily explores two key dimensions of this field: *microeconomic contracting* and *macroeconomic implicatioins*. 

On the ***microeconomic level***, I investigate how accounting reporting and regulation results in a redistribution of trade credit. This research sheds light on the unintended costs and benefits that regulatory frameworks and financial disclosures impose on the trade credit market. 

On the ***macroeconomic level***, my research seeks to deepen the understanding of how trade credit networks can act as stabilizing forces within the economy, particularly during periods of financial uncertainty and policy shifts, such as those seen during fiscal policy adjustments and the COVID-19 crisis. -->

<!-- Hi! I’m a 5th-year Accounting PhD candidate at University of Hong Kong. My research interests broadly pertain to archival financial accounting research, specialising in trade credit market. -->

<!-- Over the past three decades, many important theoretical and empirical studies on trade credit have come from the fields of finance and economics, while accounting research seems to slightly lagged behind. Although accounting research has increasingly focused on how accounting information affects the supply and demand of trade credit, a holistic view of how accounting information affects the trade credit market at whole and how trade credit networks function in the macroeconomy is still lacking. My research aims to fill this gap by providing an original and innovative perspective to deepen the understanding of trade credit from both microeconomic and macroeconomic perspectives. My research also expands the traditional motivation - the "financing advantage motivation" to incorporate other key drivers of trade credit, such as tax and product quality warranty considerations. -->

<!-- In recent decades, most important research on trade credit has come from finance and economics, with accounting slightly lagging behind. While accounting research has increasingly focused on the impact of accounting information on trade credit decisions, a holistic view of its impact on the trade credit market and the role of trade credit networks in the macroeconomy is still missing. My research fills this gap by bridging both micro and macro perspectives, and expanding the traditional "financing advantage" motivation to include factors such as taxation and quality warranty consideration through empirical evidence. -->

<!-- My research intrests focus on niche research area on trade credit market. Sepcailly, I examine it  from both microeconomic contracting persepctive ( interacted accouting reporting and regulation) and marcroeconomic implications (tax, covid, et al.).

 <!-- this with a research focus on trade financing and accounting regulations. -->

<!-- Specifically, I am interested in exploring the **economic consequences (intended and unintended) of regulations within the supply chain context** and the **role of supply chain networks in transmitting these effects to a broader economy**. 

Before studying accounting, I was a PhD candidate in Chemistry, spending three years at [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/). I received my Bachelor of Science from [Jilin University](https://global.jlu.edu.cn/) in 2017 (Rank:1/123). -->

Hi, I’m Alex Li, a fifth-year PhD student in Accounting at HKU Business School. I grew up in Wuhan, China, and have lived in Hong Kong for nearly seven years. From a young age, I enjoyed Hong Kong movies and music with my father, and I’m a fan of Leslie Cheung and George Lam ([10.12 Inches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l64xsDNAXVs)).

Before pursuing accounting, I was a physical chemistry researcher. I earned my MPhil in Chemistry from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology ([my first author paper was featured as the cover article](https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/jpcbfk.2020.124.issue-42/asset/jpcbfk.2020.124.issue-42.xlargecover-2.jpg)) and a Bachelor’s degree in Food Science from Jilin University.

In my free time, I enjoy running, hiking, cycling, reading, and playing the violin.
