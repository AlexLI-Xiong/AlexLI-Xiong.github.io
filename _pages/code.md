    [1] “Taxes and Non-debt Financing: Evidence from Trade Credit”  
    <ul>
        <li>Stage: Under review, The Accounting Review</li>
        <li>Brief: Analyzing state-level corporate income tax rate changes from 1998 to 2018, the result shows both tax increases and decreases result in reduced trade credit usage, particularly for firms with fewer covenant violations and better ex-ante liquidity positions. Analysis of customer-supplier data suggests that customer trade credit adjustments drive these effects, and reduced trade credit reliance propagates from treated states to other states through supply chain networks.</li>

    [1] “Unraveling the Pooling Equilibrium: How the Introduction of ASC 842 Triggers a Reallocation of Trade Credit” 

    <ul>
        <li>Stage:  1st R&R at The Accounting Review</li>
        <li>With <a href="https://www.hkubs.hku.hk/people/travis-chow/">Travis Chow</a> (HKU), <a href="https://www.hkubs.hku.hk/people/doyeon-kim/">Doyeon Kim</a> (HKU), and <a href="https://www.hkubs.hku.hk/people/guochang-zhang/">Guochang Zhang</a> (HKU)</li>
        <li>Brief: ASC 842 disrupts the previous pooling equilibrium, leading to a reallocation of trade credit. Firms with minimal impact on their financial reporting stand to benefit from this shift. </li>

        <li>Brief: Both state corporate income tax rate increases and decreases result in reduced trade credit usage. This effect is primarily driven by adjustments in customer trade credit practices, which then propagate through supply chain networks.</li>

    <ul>
        <li>With <a href="https://menghan-wang.github.io/">Menghan Wang</a> (HKU)</li>
        <li>Brief: Using the Pair Agreement and the US exit from the Agreement as a shock to the climate policy uncertainty, we find that corporate investment negatively correlates with the increase and decrease in climate policy uncertainty. However, the energy sector shows an asymmetric response to the uncertainty, indicating their sensitivity to policy changes. This effect is more pronounced for firms that have ex-ante higher climate-related opportunities and ex-post climate-related exposure risks.</li>

        <li>With <a href="https://www.hkubs.hku.hk/people/charles-kang/">Charles Kang</a> (HKU)</li>
        <li>Brief: We leverage the Factset Supply Chain database to pinpoint the inception year of customer-supplier relationships spanning from 2001 to 2019. By employing the TNIC code, we discern the top 10 peers, and employ the Mahalanobis distance method to ascertain the pseudo supplier. Our findings indicate that potential suppliers exhibiting a higher degree of cultural proximity are more likely to evolve into actual suppliers in the future. </li>
