<!-- [1] “Taxes and Non-debt Financing: Evidence from Trade Credit” 
- Stage: Under review, The Accounting Review
- Brief: Analyzing state-level corporate income tax rate changes from 1998 to 2018, the result shows both tax increases and decreases result in reduced trade credit usage, particularly for firms with fewer covenant violations and better ex-ante liquidity positions. Analysis of customer-supplier data suggests that customer trade credit adjustments drive these effects, and reduced trade credit reliance propagates from treated states to other states through supply chain networks. -->

        <li> Updated Abstract: I find that private firms in the European Union receive significantly less supplier credit than public firms, contrary to conventional view that private firms rely more on it for financing. I posit that public listing commits firms to higher level of disclosure, reducing suppliers’ perceived risk and raising their willingness to extend credit. Using the mandatory adoption of IFRS for public firms as a shock enforcing this commitment, I find a significantly negative spillover effect on supplier credit for private firms, particularly those with higher default risk and greater credit demand. This finding cannot be explained solely by the incremental information effect, suggesting the dominant and non-fully substitutable nature of the commitment effect in this context. Reverse regulatory shocks that enhance private firms’ commitment show negative but weaker spillover effects on public firms. Overall, my evidence shows that disclosure commitment disadvantages private firms in the trade credit market, revising the understanding of their access to credit and reconciling debates on the role of public disclosure in trade credit decisions.</li>
