I am a fourth-year PhD candidate in Accounting at Business School of [the University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/). My research focuses on the economical impact of fiscal policy and accounting regulation. My interests also extend to inter-firm financing and supply chain risk.

I hold a Mphil in computational chemistry from [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/) and a B.S. in science from [Jilin University](https://global.jlu.edu.cn/). Before studying accounting and economics, I also spent two and half years in [JQ Huang Lab](https://small.hkust.edu.hk/Publications.html) doing research in computational and physical chemistry as PhD candidate. In my spare time, I enjoy running, hiking and playing basketball.

I am visiting PhD student at Olin Business School of Washington University at St. Louis from 2023-2024.
