<!-- [1] “Taxes and Non-debt Financing: Evidence from Trade Credit” 
- Stage: Under review, The Accounting Review
- Brief: Analyzing state-level corporate income tax rate changes from 1998 to 2018, the result shows both tax increases and decreases result in reduced trade credit usage, particularly for firms with fewer covenant violations and better ex-ante liquidity positions. Analysis of customer-supplier data suggests that customer trade credit adjustments drive these effects, and reduced trade credit reliance propagates from treated states to other states through supply chain networks. -->

        <li> Abstract: I find that private European Union firms receive significantly less supplier credit than public firms,contrary to conventional view that private firms depend more on supplier credit for financing. I posit that public listing commits firms to greater responsibilities to stakeholders, enhancing suppliers’ confidence in firms’ responsible behavior and raising their willingness to offer trade credit. Using public firms’ mandatory IFRS adoption as a disclosure shock that helps enforce this commitment, I find a significantly negative spillover effect on supplier credit allocated to private firms, especially for firms exhibiting higher counterparty risk to suppliers and greater demand for supplier credit. Notably, this result cannot be explained by information effects alone. In contrast, based on two (reverse) regulatory shocks that increase private firms’ disclosure, I find weak negative spillover effects on supplier credit for public firms. Together, these asymmetrical spillover effects transmitted between private and public firms indicate that private firms are disadvantaged against public firms in the supplier credit market.</li>
